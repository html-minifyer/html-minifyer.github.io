# HTML Minifyer — Fast and Free! by NMBAH.

This is a smart tool created by <b>Not Made by a Human</b>, an indie company owned by <b>Kirey Cazkdnsky</b>. With this tool, you don't need to waste time navigating through multiple sessions or websites to compress your code. Here, you can simply paste your CSS, JS, HTML, or even everything together if you prefer. The intelligent system will minimize it as much as possible, removing unnecessary spaces, line breaks, and even comments, compressing your code to the max, all for free, fast, and without ads! Like it? You can help me by sharing this tool to other developers! That would mean a lot to me.

Thank you for using this tool, made with a lot of love and care. It was designed to address those complicated sites full of buttons and advanced information. Here, your code is compressed without hassle!

Just paste and compress. Created by one person, this tool offers what multi-million-dollar companies often don’t, as many don’t even compress your code this efficiently!

Just paste your code, no care what language it is, we minify.

Thank you so much.
